# TO-DO-LIST-APP

A simple Todo list App using Node.Js

This is a simple project i had worked on, using my knowledge in web development. This a Node.js app in which i used Html, Css, Bootstrap for the front end and MongoDB as database.

Through this web application we can add and delete our daily tasks to the TO-DO list and also customize our own lists according to our requirement.
