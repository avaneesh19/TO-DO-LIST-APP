# TO-DO-LIST-APP

A simple Todo list App using Node.Js

This is a simple project i had worked on, using my knowledge in web development. This a Node.js app in which i used Html, Css, Bootstrap for the front end and MongoDB as database.

#inside app.js
const dbLink is the remote mongoDB atlas cluster link provided by mongoDB. The link was stored in .env file for security. Paste your mongoDB link in the place of dbLink to run the application.
